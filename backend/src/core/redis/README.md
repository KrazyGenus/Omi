üìñ Contained Documentation: File-Level Breakdown
This section serves as a comprehensive documentation of each significant JavaScript file within the worker/ directory. For each file, its overall purpose is explained, followed by a detailed description of every function it contains.

### audioInferenceWorker.js
This file serves as the primary entry point for the [mention application type, e.g., "React application"]. It orchestrates the main components and sets up the overall structure and routing.

Functions:
initializeApplication()

Purpose: Sets up the initial state and configurations for the application.

Description: This function performs critical initialization tasks such as loading environment variables, connecting to the database, or setting up global state management. It ensures that the application is in a ready state before rendering or processing requests.

Parameters: None.

Returns: void (or a Promise if asynchronous initialization is involved).

renderRootComponent()

Purpose: Renders the main React component into the DOM.

Description: This function is responsible for mounting the top-level React component (e.g., <App />) to the designated root DOM element in your HTML. It typically uses ReactDOM.render() or createRoot().render().

Parameters: None.

Returns: void.



### audioExtractionWorker.js
This file encapsulates all interactions with the backend API or external data sources. It provides a clean interface for other parts of the application to fetch, create, update, and delete data.

Functions:
fetchPosts(filters = {})

Purpose: Retrieves a list of blog posts from the API.

Description: This asynchronous function sends a GET request to the /api/posts endpoint. It can accept an optional filters object to narrow down the results (e.g., by category, author, or date range). It handles API errors and returns the parsed JSON data.

Parameters: filters (Object, optional): An object containing key-value pairs for filtering the posts.

Returns: Promise<Array<Object>>: A promise that resolves to an array of post objects.

createPost(postData)

Purpose: Submits new blog post data to the API.

Description: This asynchronous function sends a POST request to the /api/posts endpoint with the provided postData. It is responsible for serializing the data (e.g., Tiptap JSON) and handling the API response, including success and error states.

Parameters: postData (Object): An object containing the data for the new post.

Returns: Promise<Object>: A promise that resolves to the newly created post object.




### dHashWorker.js
This file contains a collection of general-purpose utility functions that can be reused across different parts of the application, promoting code reusability and separation of concerns.

Functions:
formatDate(dateString)

Purpose: Formats a given date string into a more readable format.

Description: Takes an ISO date string and converts it into a user-friendly format (e.g., "July 12, 2025"). It handles potential invalid date inputs gracefully.

Parameters: dateString (String): The date string to be formatted.

Returns: String: The formatted date string.

truncateText(text, maxLength)

Purpose: Truncates a given text string to a specified maximum length, adding an ellipsis if truncated.

Description: Useful for displaying short previews of longer content. It ensures that the text does not exceed maxLength characters and appends "..." if it does.

Parameters:

text (String): The input text string.

maxLength (Number): The maximum desired length of the text.

Returns: String: The truncated text.





### frameExtractionWorker.js
This file defines a reusable React component that renders a specific part of the user interface.

Functions:
[ExampleComponent]({ prop1, prop2 }) (Functional Component)

Purpose: Renders a [describe what the component renders, e.g., "blog post card," "navigation bar"].

Description: This functional React component takes prop1 and prop2 as props. It uses these props to display dynamic content and handles user interactions such as clicks or form submissions. It is designed to be modular and reusable across different pages.

Parameters:

prop1 (Type): Description of prop1.

prop2 (Type): Description of prop2.

Returns: JSX.Element: The rendered React component.
